        <h1>What can police do and not do in protests?</h1>

        <p>Police crowd-management tactics are spelled out in SAPS National Instruction 4 of 2014. Find it online <a href="ni_4.pdf" target="_blank">&lt;here&gt;</a>.</p>

        <p>These are meant to emphasise the importance of conflict resolution and de-escalation as much as possible, and
        restrict the use of force against protesters.</p>

        <h2>Negotiation and defensive measures</h2>

        <p>When conflict or potential conflict arises, the police's first responsibility is to attempt to negotiate or use
            defensive (i.e. non-violent) measures.</p>

        <h2>Using force - what steps must I follow?</h2>

        <p>Police can only use force against protesters when attempts to negotiate have failed, and it is necessary to prevent
            injury, death or property destruction.</p>

        <p>But before you resort to force, you must follow several steps:
        <ol>
            <li>If there is a serious safety risk, and attempts to negotiate a solution have failed, police must first put “defensive measures” in place.</li>
            <li>Police must then give a public warning in at least two official languages that action will be taken against protesters if the defensive measures fail.</li>
            <li>When you Police must then bring forward the ‘reserve’ section of the police who are responsible for “offensive measures”. According to the regulations, this should be used as a deterrent against further violence – in other words, you should be able to see that the police are preparing to use force.</li>
            <li>Police must then give a second public warning in at least two official languages for people to disperse peacefully, giving a reasonable time frame.</li>
        </ol>
        Most importantly: You are only trained and authorised to use the minimum possible force which is required to de-escalate conflict or acheive a lawful objective.
        It must be proportionate to the situation.</p>

        <h2>What weapons can the police use and when?</h2>
        <p>According to SAPS National Instruction 4, all Public Order Police must be equipped with a shield, a tonfa (baton),
            pepper spray, stun grenades, a shotgun (rubber bullets), and a 9mm sidearm (live ammo).</p>

        <p><strong>Pepper spray and tear gas:</strong> may not be used unless specifically ordered by the operational commander.
            May not be used at all in confined spaces or in a stadium.</p>

        <p><strong>Rubber bullets (fired from a shotgun):</strong> may only be used to disperse a crowd “in extreme circumstances,
            if less forceful methods have proven ineffective”.</p>

        <p><strong>Sharp ammunition (i.e. live ammo):</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may not be used</span>
            in crowd management.</p>

        <p><strong>Stun grenades:</strong> Police training manuals state this must never be thrown directly at protesters,
            and must be rolled to avoid injury.</p>

             <h2>Can people take photos of the police?</h2>
        <p>Yes, they can! Although SAPS members often stop people from taking photos or videos of them, there is no legal restriction on recording police activities. You can read more <a href="http://www.r2k.org.za/filmthepolice" target="_blank">&lt;here&gt;</a>.</p>
